This is an Nginx fork that adds dtrace USDT probes.

This is still under development and not usable yet.

Basic usage:

    ./configure --with-dtrace-probes \
        --with-dtrace=/usr/sbin/dtrace \
        ...

For now, only tested on Solaris 11 Express and Fedora Linux 17.

The original Nginx documentation is available at http://nginx.org
